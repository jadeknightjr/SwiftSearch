# SwiftSearch
Finalist Entry for SWIFT's internal Hackathon. It's a basic search engine for SWIFT's employees and coding languages. We utilized Django and TreantJS to make it work. For the admin page, the username is: "admin" and the password is: "pass1234". While buggy, we are satisisfied with how it turned out given the bvery short time period and our lack of experience with django. Names are either blotted out or have been changed (except mine :) ).
